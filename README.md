# ExcelTestFSharp

Last year, I wrote a short script for my dad to turn an excel data file into an XML file to upload to a government server.
I used perl for that one, but I thought F# might be nicer.
This is my attempt at using F# and type providers to turn the data file into an xml file.
It's worked pretty well...

I didn't include the excel file or the schema, because they don't technically belong to me.
